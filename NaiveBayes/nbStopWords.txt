After trying N from 1 to 50, we can see that if N = 19, the accuracy increases to 0.83. But if N is larger than 37, the accuracy increases to 0.8611. considering the first group for (split.train, split.test) I would consider to select N = 19, cause though deleting more words, like 37 would increase the accuracy, but it is only for one test. And it might increases the uncertainty, so I would prefer N = 19.
